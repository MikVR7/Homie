# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing frontend for the Homie File Organizer module. The current Flutter implementation is functional but lacks the polish and user experience expected from a modern application. This project will redesign and enhance the frontend while maintaining compatibility with the existing Python backend architecture.

The File Organizer is an AI-powered file organization system that uses Google Gemini to intelligently categorize and organize files based on content analysis, existing folder structures, and user preferences. The new frontend should make this powerful functionality accessible through an elegant, easy-to-use interface.

## Requirements

4. WHEN the user accesses the application on different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and adaptive

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily select source and destination folders through an intuitive file browser, so that I don't have to manually type file paths.

2. WHEN the user selects a folder in the browser THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the input field with the selected path
3. WHEN the user browses folders THEN the system SHALL show folder icons, names, and basic metadata (file count, size)
4. WHEN the user has recently used folders THEN the system SHALL display them as quick-select options
5. WHEN the user types in a folder path THEN the system SHALL provide auto-completion suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a real-time preview of what the AI will do to my files before executing any operations, so that I can review and approve changes confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive preview of all planned operations
2. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the user SHALL see file names, current locations, proposed destinations, and operation types
3. WHEN the user reviews operations THEN they SHALL be able to approve, modify, or reject individual operations
4. WHEN operations involve creating new folders THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which folders will be created
5. WHEN the user hovers over an operation THEN the system SHALL show additional details and reasoning from the AI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the progress of file operations in real-time with clear status updates, so that I know what's happening and can track completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations begin THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing overall completion percentage
2. WHEN each operation executes THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates for individual files
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of successful and failed operations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN operations are running THEN the user SHALL be able to pause or cancel the process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced drive monitoring interface that shows connected drives with visual indicators and easy selection, so that I can quickly organize files from USB drives and external storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drives are connected or disconnected THEN the system SHALL update the drive list in real-time
2. WHEN viewing available drives THEN the system SHALL display drive icons, names, available space, and connection status
3. WHEN the user clicks on a drive THEN the system SHALL automatically set it as the source folder
4. WHEN drives have been used before THEN the system SHALL show historical usage and suggested organization patterns
5. WHEN a drive is selected THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to common folders on that drive

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent organization presets and customization options that learn from my preferences, so that I can organize files according to my specific needs and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects an organization style THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions and examples of each option
2. WHEN using custom organization THEN the system SHALL provide helpful prompts and suggestions based on file types
3. WHEN the user has organized files before THEN the system SHALL suggest organization patterns based on history
4. WHEN creating custom rules THEN the system SHALL allow saving and reusing organization presets
5. WHEN the AI makes suggestions THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind each organizational decision

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive file and folder insights that help me understand my storage usage and organization patterns, so that I can make informed decisions about file management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a folder THEN the system SHALL display file type distribution, size analysis, and organization suggestions
2. WHEN viewing folder contents THEN the system SHALL show duplicate files, large files, and unused files
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide before/after comparisons and space savings
4. WHEN viewing drive information THEN the system SHALL show storage usage trends and recommendations
5. WHEN the user requests insights THEN the system SHALL generate actionable recommendations for better organization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration with the existing backend system while experiencing improved performance and reliability, so that the enhanced frontend works flawlessly with current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend communicates with the backend THEN it SHALL use the existing WebSocket and REST API endpoints
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear status indicators and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain synchronization between frontend and backend state
5. WHEN the user performs operations THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing database and file structures

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features that make the application usable for everyone, so that I can work efficiently regardless of my abilities or preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL execute corresponding actions (Ctrl+O for organize, Ctrl+E for execute, etc.)
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all interface elements SHALL be properly labeled and navigable
3. WHEN the user has motor impairments THEN the interface SHALL support keyboard-only navigation
4. WHEN the user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL support high contrast modes and proper color contrast ratios

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) with platform-appropriate interactions, so that I can organize files from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the desktop version (Windows, macOS, Linux) THEN the system SHALL integrate with native file managers and system notifications
