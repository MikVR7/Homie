## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose non-destructive operations as default for safety
- Decided on modular, extensible design
- Prioritized performance for large file sets

### Technology Decisions
- [To be documented as decisions are made]

## Lessons Learned

### Flutter Linux Desktop Development
- **Flutter Linux is NOT production ready**: Severe rendering issues on Linux desktop environments
- **Linux Mint compatibility**: Particularly problematic with constant UI flickering and dialog corruption
- **Debug flags are harmful**: Flutter debug flags cause additional rendering problems
- **Provider context in dialogs**: Complex state management in dialogs leads to widget tree corruption
- **ListView.builder issues**: Scrollable content triggers infinite layout errors in dialogs

### User Requirements Management
- **Tab structure clarity**: User expectations must be precisely documented and followed
- **Feature location matters**: Functionality placement (button vs tab) is critical for UX
- **UI design preferences**: Clean, minimal, professional design without information overload
- **Platform targeting**: Mobile-first approach essential for cross-platform compatibility

### Technical Debt & Solutions
- **Flutter Web workaround**: Use Chrome for development on Linux systems
- **State management complexity**: Simple, static dialogs preferred over complex Provider patterns
- **Error cascade prevention**: Single point of failure in dialog state can corrupt entire widget tree
- **Documentation importance**: Comprehensive issue tracking prevents repeated failed attempts

## Future Considerations

- Regular architecture reviews
- Performance benchmarking milestones
- User feedback integration points
