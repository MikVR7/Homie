# Project History

## Development Guidelines ðŸ“‹
**See `GENERAL_RULES.md` for complete development guidelines including date management, commit formats, and coding standards.**

## Timeline

### 2025-07-22
- **Module-Specific Launch Scripts**: Created standalone module launch scripts for focused user experience
- **Command Line Route Arguments**: Implemented Flutter app support for runtime route specification
- **Conditional Navigation**: Added back button removal for standalone module launches
- **Architecture Decision**: Decided to maintain single codebase instead of module exclusion from builds
- **Flutter Linux Issues Discovered**: Identified severe rendering problems on Linux Mint
- **Black Popup Dialog Investigation**: Extensive troubleshooting of Add Security dialog corruption
- **Tab Structure Corrections**: Fixed Financial Manager tab configuration (Overview + Construction only)
- **Web Development Workaround**: Created start_frontend_web.sh for Flutter Web development
- **Failed Fix Attempts**: Documented all attempted solutions for rendering issues

### 2025-01-08
- **UI Flickering Investigation**: Deep dive into Flutter desktop rendering problems
- **Debug Flag Testing**: Tested various Flutter debug configurations
- **Provider State Management**: Attempted Provider isolation and callback patterns
- **Widget Layout Simplification**: Replaced ListView.builder with Column widgets (failed)

### 2025-07-01
- **Project Inception**: Created initial project structure
- **Documentation Setup**: Established docs/ and .warp/ folders for comprehensive project documentation
- **Planning Phase**: Defined core architecture and development workflow

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose non-destructive operations as default for safety
- Decided on modular, extensible design
- Prioritized performance for large file sets

### Technology Decisions
- [To be documented as decisions are made]

## Lessons Learned

### Flutter Linux Desktop Development
- **Flutter Linux is NOT production ready**: Severe rendering issues on Linux desktop environments
- **Linux Mint compatibility**: Particularly problematic with constant UI flickering and dialog corruption
- **Debug flags are harmful**: Flutter debug flags cause additional rendering problems
- **Provider context in dialogs**: Complex state management in dialogs leads to widget tree corruption
- **ListView.builder issues**: Scrollable content triggers infinite layout errors in dialogs

### User Requirements Management
- **Tab structure clarity**: User expectations must be precisely documented and followed
- **Feature location matters**: Functionality placement (button vs tab) is critical for UX
- **UI design preferences**: Clean, minimal, professional design without information overload
- **Platform targeting**: Mobile-first approach essential for cross-platform compatibility
- **Focused User Experience**: Users prefer dedicated module launches without navigation distractions
- **Single-Purpose Apps**: Back button removal enhances focused workflow experience

### Technical Debt & Solutions
- **Flutter Web workaround**: Use Chrome for development on Linux systems
- **State management complexity**: Simple, static dialogs preferred over complex Provider patterns
- **Error cascade prevention**: Single point of failure in dialog state can corrupt entire widget tree
- **Documentation importance**: Comprehensive issue tracking prevents repeated failed attempts
- **Architecture Simplicity**: Single codebase with conditional UI preferred over build complexity
- **Runtime Configuration**: Command line arguments enable flexible app behavior without build changes

## Future Considerations

- Regular architecture reviews
- Performance benchmarking milestones
- User feedback integration points
