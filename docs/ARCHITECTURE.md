- **Elastic IPs**: Stable endpoints for connection brokering

#### Security & Access
- **Certificate Manager**: SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS access
- **WAF**: Web application firewall for external-facing components
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of API keys and tokens

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits
- Home server maintains data sovereignty
- AWS services provide global connectivity infrastructure
- Cost-effective: only pay for cloud services actually used
- Fallback connectivity when home network is unreachable
