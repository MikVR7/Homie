## Detailed System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
[File System] → [Scanner] → [Metadata Extractor] → [Organization Engine]
      ↓              ↓              ↓                     ↓
 [File Watcher] → [Event Queue] → [Rules Engine] → [Action Executor]
      ↓              ↓              ↓                     ↓
 [User Interface] ← [Progress Monitor] ← [Logging System] ← [Operations Log]
```
