# Project History

## 2025-10-15

- Implemented /api/file-organizer/explain-operation endpoint for on-demand 'Why?' explanations
- AI generates human-friendly 2-3 sentence explanations only when user clicks 'Why?' button
- Includes automatic model recovery if AI fails
- Complete on-demand explanation system now ready for frontend integration
## 2025-10-15

- MAJOR PERFORMANCE FIX: Changed from individual AI calls to batch analysis
- Speed improvement: 60 seconds (12 files Ã— 5s) â†’ ~5 seconds total (ONE batch call)
- Removed wasteful 'reason' generation - now only generated on-demand when user clicks 'Why?'
- API efficiency: 12 API calls â†’ 1 API call per organization
## 2025-10-15

- Added persistent model configuration in backend/data/config/ai_service.json
- System now remembers the last working AI model across restarts
- Model selection priority: 1) User override (GEMINI_MODEL), 2) Last working model, 3) Default (gemini-flash-latest)
- Discovered models are automatically saved when validated
## 2025-10-15

- Optimized AI initialization - no performance impact on startup (< 100ms)
- Implemented runtime auto-recovery - if model fails after years, system automatically discovers and switches to working model
- Model discovery is lazy/on-demand - only happens when first needed or on failure
- Transparent recovery - failed AI requests automatically retry with discovered model
## 2025-10-15

- Implemented dynamic Gemini model discovery - system automatically finds and ranks available models
- Added GEMINI_MODEL environment variable for user override
- Future-proof: Will automatically adapt to new Google AI models without code changes
- Scoring system prefers: flash models > latest aliases > higher versions, avoids experimental/preview
## 2025-10-14

- Fixed critical bug: AI errors now return detailed diagnostic messages instead of generic failures
- Implemented batch operation resilience - individual file failures no longer crash entire operations
- Added .env.example file with required configuration template
- Improved error handling in analyze_file and _analyze_with_ai methods
## 2025-10-14

- Removed all hardcoded category mappings - AI now has complete freedom to create any folder structure.
- Backend is now category-agnostic and only passes data between frontend and AI.
- AI prompt updated to encourage creative, granular folder organization.
- Removed hardcoded fallback suggestions in suggest-destination endpoint.
## 2025-10-14

- Fixed the `reason` field in the `/api/file-organizer/organize` endpoint to use AI-generated explanations directly.
- Improved the AI prompt in `suggest-alternatives` to generate more diverse and relevant suggestions.
- Simplified the reason generation logic by letting the AI handle all explanation text.
## 2025-10-14

- Refactored the `/api/file-organizer/suggest-alternatives` endpoint to use a `rejected_operation` object.
- Improved the `reason` field in the `/api/file-organizer/organize` endpoint with AI-driven descriptions.
- Removed fallback logic in `AIContentAnalyzer` to enforce AI availability and return errors on failure.
- Updated the test suite to correctly handle AI-disabled scenarios.
## 2025-10-14

- Implemented the `/api/file-organizer/suggest-alternatives` endpoint.
- Added AI-powered alternative suggestion generation for file organization.
- Included a fallback mechanism for suggestions when AI is unavailable.
- Updated documentation for the new content analysis features.
## 2025-10-13

- Enhanced content analyzer with AI-powered dynamic categorization
- Integrated Google Gemini for intelligent file categorization
- Added support for: music, ebooks, tutorials, projects, assets (3D models, brushes, plugins, fonts)
- No hardcoded categories - AI determines types dynamically
- Regex fallback system for speed when AI unavailable
- Added use_ai parameter to batch endpoint for controlling AI usage
- AI can now detect: movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, tutorials, courses, projects, assets, documents
- AI extracts project types (Unity, .NET, Rust, Flutter) from filenames
- Added suggested_folder field to AI responses for organization hints
- Updated documentation with AI integration details
## 2025-10-13

- Enhanced File Organizer content analysis endpoint
- Implemented movie filename parsing (title, year, quality, release group)
- Added TV show detection with season/episode extraction
- Implemented archive content listing for ZIP/RAR/7z files
- Added image EXIF data extraction support
- Implemented PDF invoice detection and basic metadata extraction
- Added graceful degradation for files not accessible locally
- All content types now return lowercase (movie, tvshow, image, archive, document, etc.)
- Confidence scoring system for all analysis results
- Comprehensive test suite with 16+ test cases passing
## 2025-10-07 - Version -

- Fixed a critical UI flow bug where the initial 'Let's Sort!' button was triggering the wrong event, bypassing the destination setup process.
- Correctly wired the `AreaTop` button to the `Pub_AreaTopOnBtnClickLetsSort` event.
- Enhanced logging in `FileOrganizerWindow` to better trace the destination setup and folder picker flow.
### 2025-10-07
- Created new documentation: UI_AI_SUGGESTION.md - UI AI Suggestion
  - Reason: To store the UI suggestion provided by the external AI for future reference, as requested by the user.

- [To be documented as decisions are made]

## Lessons Learned

### Flutter Linux Desktop Development
- **Flutter Linux is NOT production ready**: Severe rendering issues on Linux desktop environments
- **Linux Mint compatibility**: Particularly problematic with constant UI flickering and dialog corruption
- **Debug flags are harmful**: Flutter debug flags cause additional rendering problems
- **Provider context in dialogs**: Complex state management in dialogs leads to widget tree corruption
- **ListView.builder issues**: Scrollable content triggers infinite layout errors in dialogs

### User Requirements Management
- **Tab structure clarity**: User expectations must be precisely documented and followed
- **Feature location matters**: Functionality placement (button vs tab) is critical for UX
- **UI design preferences**: Clean, minimal, professional design without information overload
- **Platform targeting**: Mobile-first approach essential for cross-platform compatibility
- **Focused User Experience**: Users prefer dedicated module launches without navigation distractions
- **Single-Purpose Apps**: Back button removal enhances focused workflow experience

### Technical Debt & Solutions
- **Flutter Web workaround**: Use Chrome for development on Linux systems
- **State management complexity**: Simple, static dialogs preferred over complex Provider patterns
- **Error cascade prevention**: Single point of failure in dialog state can corrupt entire widget tree
- **Documentation importance**: Comprehensive issue tracking prevents repeated failed attempts
- **Architecture Simplicity**: Single codebase with conditional UI preferred over build complexity
- **Runtime Configuration**: Command line arguments enable flexible app behavior without build changes

## Future Considerations

- Regular architecture reviews
- Performance benchmarking milestones
- User feedback integration points
