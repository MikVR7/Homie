## Usage Examples

### Basic Mobile Platform Detection
```dart
if (MobilePlatformService.isMobilePlatform) {
  // Mobile-specific code
  final platform = MobilePlatformService.currentPlatform;
  final features = MobilePlatformService.getPlatformFeatures();
}
```

### Haptic Feedback
```dart
await MobilePlatformService.triggerHapticFeedback(HapticFeedbackType.medium);
```

### Touch Gestures
```dart
MobileTouchGestures.swipeToDelete(
  onDelete: () => deleteItem(),
  child: ListTile(title: Text('Swipe to delete')),
)
```

### Performance Optimization
```dart
final optimizedList = MobilePerformanceOptimizer.optimizeListView(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(title: Text('Item $index')),
  itemCount: 1000,
  enableVirtualScrolling: true,
);
```
