  String _sourcePath = '';
  String _destinationPath = '';
  OrganizationStyle _organizationStyle = OrganizationStyle.smartCategories;
  
  // Operation state
  List<FileOperation> _operations = [];
  OperationStatus _status = OperationStatus.idle;
  
  // Drive state
  List<DriveInfo> _drives = [];
  DriveInfo? _selectedDrive;
  
  // Analytics state
  FolderAnalytics? _analytics;
  List<OrganizationPreset> _presets = [];
}
```

### Real-time Communication
```dart
// WebSocket integration for live updates
class WebSocketProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  ConnectionStatus _connectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.disconnected;
  Stream<Map<String, dynamic>>? _eventStream;
  
  void connect() async {
    // Establish WebSocket connection
    // Handle real-time events
    // Manage connection lifecycle
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Implementation
```dart
// Comprehensive accessibility support
class AccessibilityProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  bool _highContrastMode = false;
  double _textScale = 1.0;
