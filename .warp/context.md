## Key Architecture Principles
1. **Non-destructive by default** - Always suggest moves, never delete without explicit permission
2. **User control** - Users can configure automation level and override any decision
3. **Performance-first** - Designed to handle large file sets efficiently
4. **Extensible** - Modular design for easy feature additions
5. **Mobile-first** - Cross-platform Flutter app with responsive design
6. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Single codebase for all platforms
